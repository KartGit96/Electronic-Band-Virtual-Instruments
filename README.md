# Electronic Band: Virtual Musical Instruments
Team built a band of 4 musical instruments-Guitar, Keyboard, Drums, and Bass guitar, using Teensyduino processors and sensors such as IR for the guitar and keys, accelerometers and piezoelectric for the drums and bass guitar. Independently built the bass guitar and performed an independent song. Performed a song with the team/band using the 4 chord logic for the “Embedded Systems Challenge-Battle of the bands” event at NYU and received a great response from faculty.
